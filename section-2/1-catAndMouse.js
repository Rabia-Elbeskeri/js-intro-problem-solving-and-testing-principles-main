  You will be given an array containing string representations of the locations of a cat and a mouse. The array may also contains walls represented by "W".
  You will also be given a positive integer which represents how far the cat can jump.

  Your task is to calculate if the cat can jump far enough to catch the mouse. 

  Each space "x" expends 1 of the cat's movement, and each wall "W" expends 2. 
  It does not matter if the cat is before or after the mouse in the array.

  E.g. 
    calculateJump(["cat", "W", "mouse"], 5)
    // => true
